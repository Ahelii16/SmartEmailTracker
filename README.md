##Topic : AI/ Machine Learning for Decision Making (Project 2)

The current project has lots of content in emails post which the ops user has to perform some manual operation like collateral postings, collateral booking, dispute discrepancy etc. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning decision making matrix we could automate the processes. The system aims do the following:

-Reading the email content with certain subject line. Set of files treated as an email and extract the contact out of it and train the system to build its decision making capability.

-The system should continuously improve the modelâ€™s decision making skill by monitoring all the emails with the defined subject line. To simulate this use case, create a folder in any server and have a background listener continuously monitoring the folder, any new file comes at any moment the system should read its content to train the model.

-Based on the event type received in the email the system will take the desired actions like booking a collateral or resolve the dispute etc.
